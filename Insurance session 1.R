# where y = insurance charges
# x1 = age of the person
# x2  sex of the person
# x3 = bmi of the person
# x4 = children
# x5 = smoker
# x6 = region
# It is clear that x1, and x3 are continuous and x2, x4, x5, x6 are categorical
# therefore we need to create dummy variables for the categorical
# variables
# For the sex variable x2
# x2 = 1 if person is male
# x2 = 0 if person is female
